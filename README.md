# Keypoints-for-UFPR-ADMR

This repository contains the annotations with keypoints for a subset of the UFPR ADMR dataset (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9207318). The UFPR-ADMR is a public upon request dataset containing real multi-dial meters. These annotations were developed as part of my graduation thesis.

The annotations for each digit are the coordinates (in pixels) of the center of the dial, point of the dial, and the mark "zero" on the scale.
